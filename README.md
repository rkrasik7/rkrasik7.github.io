CS 498: Data Visualization	Summer 2018  
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)  

This, d3.js (v4) final project, part of CS 498 Data Visualization course in UUIC, uses a hybrid approach of an Interactive Slideshow in order to narrate the visual story of Financial Market dataset from FINVIZ.COM. The Interactive Slideshow takes the user throughout the July-09 2018 single trading day, from high-level to low-level details.

# Recommended View Settings  
As the visualizations use a preset static canvas of 1024x768 pixels, the viewing size of the Interactive Slideshow is at least 1280x800 pixels (laptop screen or a monitor are advised) in order to accommodate the visualizations, surrounding text and scene elements. The system was comprehensively tested on Windows 10 (Chrome, Firefox) and MacOS (Chrome, Safari).
