          <h2>About the Visualization</h2>
          <small>
            <p>
              This, d3.js (v4) final project, part of CS 498 Data Visualization course in UUIC, uses a hybrid approach of an <b><font color="black">Interactive Slideshow</font></b> in order to narrate
              the visual story of Financial Market dataset from FINVIZ.COM. The Interactive Slideshow takes the user throughout
              the July-09 2018 </u>single trading day</u>, zooming from high-to-low level insights (more details to follow).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Interactive Slideshow is built using <font color="teal"><u>scenes</u></font> with
	      <font color="teal"><u>annotations</u></font>, while having <font color="teal"><u>parameters</u></font> connected with the related <font color="teal"><u>triggers</u></font>. 
	      In order to preserve <b>visual consistency</b> along the Slideshow, strict and constant templates are being used.   
              More elaboration and details related to all the mentioned elements and of course the visualizations to follow later.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b><p style="color:black">Recommended View Settings</p></b> As the visualizations use a preset static canvas of 1024x768 pixels, the viewing size of the Interactive
              Slideshow is at least 1280x800 pixels (laptop screen or a monitor are advised) in order to accommodate the visualizations, surrounding text and scene elements. 
              The system was <u>comprehensively tested</u> on Windows 10 (Chrome, Firefox) and MacOS (Chrome, Safari).

          <h4>ELEMENTS OF NARRATION</h4>
          <small class="less-font">
            <ol>
              <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
                <strong><font color="teal">Scenes</font></strong>
              </li>
              <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
                Scenes are the slides that make up the Slideshow; these slides can be easily navigated using the guiding arrows in the
                <img src="images/arrow.png" style="border: none; background:none; box-shadow:none; margin: 8px 0 0 0;" height="8" width="8"> corner. The use of CSS and FullPage.js allows for a consistent template look for the Interactive Slideshow
                visualization; each page is transitioned using the same method, while the main concepts are kept the same (e.g. font family).
                As noted, the <u><b>smart navigation control between pages</b></u> allows users to easily and smoothly navigate between the slides.
              </p>
              <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">
                <strong><font color="teal">Annotations</font></strong>
              </li>
              <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Annotions are the miscellaneous
                <strong>labels</strong>,
                <strong>tooltips</strong> and 
                <strong>legends</strong>; those display the key attributes from our Dataset (more details on the latter to follow) - such as Company, Country, Market Capitalization
                and Sector. The tooltips are triggered when the user interactively moves the mouse over the visualization elements
                and this invokes the display parameters for the each relevant item and hence it becomes visible to the user.</p>
              <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">In general, the annotations that are being used in the visualizations all have a similar process of using triggers
                to change the hidden parameter of the annotation. For example, the
                <strong>INTERACTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE WORLD</strong> chart has an initial state of the hidden parameter which controls
                the display of the annotations set to <u>false</u> value. As the user triggers changes to the chart parameters, it also
                changes this hidden parameter to <u>true</u> value. In its' turn, the annotations disappear until the user resets chart to default - meaning 
                zooming out back to the chart default visualization parameters.
              </p>
              <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">
                <strong><font color="teal">Parameters</font></strong>
              </li>
              <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6">Parameters are the main characteristic attributes of the Slideshow, in our case they are 
                <strong>Company</strong>,
                <strong>Sector</strong>,
                <strong>Market Capitalization </strong> and
                <strong>Country</strong>. There are additional parameters that are listed in the
                <strong>Dataset</strong>, yet those are relatively minor and appear as details in the visualization charts, 
                rather being considered as one of main parameters for the visualizations.</p>
              <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7">
                <strong><font color="teal">Triggers</font></strong>
              </li>
              <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8">
              Triggers are easy discoverable by the end-user <strong>Zoom</strong> and <strong>Brush</strong> filter,
              and <strong>buttons</strong> with related control details. Triggers are being used in order to invoke updates in the 
		      visualizations based on the new parameters set by the end-user.</p>
              <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8">
                <font color="viridian">Both parameters and triggers are intensively used in all of the visualizations, with an emphasis on the
                <strong>INTERACTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE WORLD</strong> and
                <strong>MAJOR COMPANIES INTERACTIVE INSIGHTS</strong> charts. For example, in
                <strong>INTERACTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE WORLD
                </strong> chart parameters for the (x, y) coordinates of each Bubble are set to an initial central position for
                the
                <strong>All Companies</strong> Visualization. As the user selects various grouping options (Sector, Country and Market
                Capitalization) it triggers the change of the Bubble’s (x, y) coordinates parameter to their respective groupings.
                In the
                <strong>MAJOR COMPANIES INTERACTIVE INSIGHTS</strong> chart, every mouse click on a region is a
                trigger for the path and arc parameters. By clicking within a region, the user zooms into the data information underneath, 
                while clicking the central circle will trigger the parameters to return to
                its values a level up in the hierarchy.</font>

          <h3>WHAT IS NEXT?</h3>
          <small>This was quite a humble attempt to present various visualizations of financial data in an easy interactive manner to the end user. 
            <b>Obviously, these financial insights are just a beginning!</b>
            <br>
            <br>On top of various visualizations and possible extensions, we haven't even visualized a very significant dimension for the stocks analysis - the time; 
            an obvious next step would be finding trends in stock prices and volumes - how those have changed over the time (years, months, weeks, days and within the day). 
            For the latter process, a more automated data flow should be setup via a SW API (comparing to one time data export as was done for this project...).
